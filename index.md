## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a second year Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. Math, Physics, and Computer Science have captured my curiosity since I can remember, and I chose Mechanical Engineering for the opportunity to continue to study all three of my favorite subjects, and to apply them to real-world projects that impact the world around me. I am open to conversations about potential career paths that align with my interests, particularly ones focused on aerospace, flight physics, and computer modeling.
