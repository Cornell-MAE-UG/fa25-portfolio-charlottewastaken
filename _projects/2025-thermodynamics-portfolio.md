As part of my Thermodynamics class at Cornell University, we were granted the opportunity to participate in a heat exchanger lab, in which we collected initial and final temperature data on two streams of water flowing through the device. Additionally, we explored the impact of adjusting whether the device was running in counter flow or parallel flow.  

Our experimental setup is shown in the above image. The setup consisted of two reservoirs of water - one containing hot water; the other cold water. Tubes were placed into each container, which routed the water through the heat exchanger and into two empty "discard" buckets at the other side. 

First, the temperature was measured in the initial hot and cold water reservoirs. Then, the heat exchanger was run for approximately two minutes, or until the water ran out. Lastly, the temperatures in the "discard" buckets were measured. This process was repeated for running the heat exchanger in "counter-flow" and "parallel flow" - ie, changing the direction of one of the two flows. The data collected from this process is shown in Figure 2.

After collecting the data, I analyzed the heat exchanger device using course concepts of control volume energy balance.
