For my Statics and Mechanics of Solids class at Cornell University, we were given a design challenge to design a frame or mechanism capable of lifting the maximum possible weight to the greatest possible height. The materials given were a rigid bar of a fixed length of our choice, three pin supports, one of them needing to be fixed on the ground, and a linear actuator which needed to be selected from an online catalog. Additionally, the design was constrained to a 2D space 150cm long and 50cm high. 

I oriented my design as shown in the sketch, with my bar fixed to a support on the ground, with the actuator positioned such that it can raise the bar. I selected the actuator based on which one would fit in the dimension constraints, and landed on the IMA 22, which will provide a force of 36 kN. I plan to continue to iterate on this design and develop specific calculations for maximum weight supported and maximum height.
