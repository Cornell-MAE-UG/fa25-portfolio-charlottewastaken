#### Objective
Math, Physics, and Computer Science have captured my curiosity since I can remember. I chose Mechanical Engineering for the opportunity to continue to study all three of my favorite subjects, and to apply them to real-world projects that impact the world around me. I am open to conversations about potential career paths that align with my interests, particularly ones focused on aerospace, flight physics, and computer modeling.
